----------------------------------------

Halevi Canonical — Why it works:

- High perceptual clarity
- Calm, observational authority
- Explains the predictable cognitive effects of the writing without pretending to read the individual reader’s mind
- Concludes without theatrics
- Describes what the writing does to a reasonable reader rather than narrating the reader’s inner thoughts.
