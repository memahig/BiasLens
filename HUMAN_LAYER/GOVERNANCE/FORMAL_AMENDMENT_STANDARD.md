🛡️ BiasLens — Formal Amendment Standard  
Status: Governance Control Mechanism  

Purpose:
Ensure that changes to governing documents occur deliberately, rarely, and only when epistemic rigor or system safety is materially improved.

────────────────────────────────

AMENDMENT THRESHOLD

Governing documents may be amended only when at least ONE of the following conditions is met:

• Epistemic safety is strengthened  
• Governance clarity is materially improved  
• Architectural evolution requires it  
• A contradiction or authority ambiguity is resolved  
• Regulatory, legal, or institutional readiness demands it  

Convenience, stylistic preference, or temporary implementation details are not sufficient justification.

────────────────────────────────

AMENDMENT PROCESS

Before modifying any governing document, perform the following pause:

1. State the reason for the amendment in one sentence.
2. Ask: “Is this constitutional, or merely architectural?”
3. Consider waiting 24 hours unless the change resolves a clear safety risk.
4. Implement the amendment with full-document replacement.
5. Increment the version number.
6. Record the change in AMENDMENT_LOG.md.

STABILITY PRINCIPLE

BiasLens governance is designed to provide institutional gravity.

Amend slowly.  
Learn rapidly.  

Frequent constitutional change is a systemic risk.

Stability is a feature.

────────────────────────────────

AUTHORITY

If uncertainty exists about whether a change belongs in governance:

Default to NOT amending.

Time is an effective filter for constitutional decisions.
