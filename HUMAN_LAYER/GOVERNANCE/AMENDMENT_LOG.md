I. Perception and Scoring Invariants (Anti-Evasion / Anti-Reroll)

A. Commitment / Obligation Primitive (Perception Lock)
BiasLens omission detection SHALL operate on semantic commitments that generate epistemic obligations
(e.g., trend, causation, comparison, scope generalization) and evaluate whether required parameters
(time window, baseline, comparator class, mechanism/evidence type, population scope, etc.) are present.

Keyword/wordlist detection MAY be used only as temporary scaffolding or low-cost baseline telemetry.
Lexical triggers SHALL NOT be treated as the primary perception strategy, since they are evadable via paraphrase.

B. Probabilistic Perception Allowed; Deterministic Scoring Required
Perception candidate generation MAY be probabilistic and multi-model.
However, stars/scores SHALL be deterministic and stable for identical input text/artifacts to prevent rerolling.

Stars/scores MUST be computed only from canonical, evidence-anchored, validator-approved audit artifacts
produced by the Facts→Claims→Arguments→Article pipeline.
Unanchored, non-canonical, or disputed candidates SHALL NOT affect scoring.


## Amendment — Constitution v4  
Title: Inquiry Integrity Requirement  
Date: 2026-02-18  

Reason:  
Failure to audit inquiry structure was identified as a primary epistemic safety vulnerability capable of corrupting downstream analysis.

Change:  
Added a Core Epistemic Principle requiring structural evaluation of inquiries before responses may be epistemically assessed.

Impact:  
Seals a primary reasoning-entry vulnerability, preventing premise contamination, framing capture, and downstream analytic distortion.

Classification: Epistemic Safety Amendment.
