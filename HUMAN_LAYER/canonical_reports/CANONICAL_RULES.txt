BIASLENS CANONICAL RULES

1. Capture immediately when authority is observed.
2. Never edit a canonical after saving.
3. Canonicals are floors, not ceilings.
4. Do not over-analyze a single exemplar.
5. Expand principles only after multiple canonicals exist.
6. Protect perceptual authority above stylistic preference.
