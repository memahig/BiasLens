READER BRAIN TARGET STATE

BiasLens Reader reports should help a reasonable reader SEE how a piece of writing operates — not tell the reader what to think, and not simulate the reader’s inner psychology.

Desired Qualities:

- Perceptually clear
- Calm authority
- Observational, not prosecutorial
- Describes rhetorical mechanics and cognitive effects
- Concludes without theatrical escalation
- Respects reader autonomy
